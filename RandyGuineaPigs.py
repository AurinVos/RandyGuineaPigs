st.title("🐹 Guinea Pig Shagging Simulator")
st.markdown("""
Welcome to the **Guinea Pig Shagging Simulator**, a playful yet statistically inspired app that lets you explore the surprising dynamics of rodent reproduction.

This project was sparked by a delightfully randy blog post by [Caroline Jagtenberg](https://blog.vvsor.nl/author/carolinejagtenberg/), an accomplished mathematical mind and occasional humorist. Her recent piece — _“Maths for Matings: Guinea Pig Gone Viral”_ — takes a cheeky look at Randy, a rather prolific male guinea pig with a single-minded mission. 

[Go and read that first if you have not yet done so!](https://blog.vvsor.nl/2025/05/maths-for-matings-guinea-pig-gone-viral/).

While Caroline’s take is undeniably hilarious, it focused heavily on the **male perspective**: the valiant efforts of one shag-happy rodent. But what about the **females**? Surely being on the receiving end of this randy rampage isn't effortless — especially when the shags keep coming *even after* pregnancy.

This app was developed after Streamlit had sat on my "to explore" list for over a year. Caroline’s blog was the push I needed to dive in — and to rebalance the narrative. You see, in a truly **randy situation**, it’s not just the male driving the data. The females endure their own statistical journey — and now, you can stimulate (ah, crap a typo) it.

Use the controls in the sidebar to experiment with population size, pregnancy probabilities, and explore what happens when you start asking: _How many shags does it take?_ And more importantly: _What do the females go through in the process?_

Curious about the code? Check out my amazing code annotations below.

Enjoy!

This app simulates guinea pig shagging sessions until a target number of pregnancies is achieved. Two functions do the heavy lifting:

- `simulate_matings(...)`: simulates one round of shagging and returns snuggle stats per female.
- `run_simulations(...)`: runs the above multiple times to provide meaningful distributions.

Here's how the functions are structured:
```python
def simulate_matings(n_females=10, target_pregnancies=1, 
                     pregnancy_chance=0.091, pregnant_chance=0.0):

    The results Caroline found that, in order to get 100 pregnant guinea pics, 1330 shags were needed for a population of 300 females while 5700 shags were needed for a population of 100 Guinea Pigs.

    Apparently, getting randy with a small population of females asks much more of that small population, especially if the requirement is to get all of your fellow females pregnant!
    It is quite simple when you think about it. Once most of the females are pregnant it is quite hard to shag a female that is not pregnant.
    There are probably other biological factors like hormones and stuff that will make sure a still-to-be-pregnant female finds a shag more easily than her pregnant buddies. But not in this simulation.
